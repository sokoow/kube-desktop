# kube-desktop

## WHY?

Couple of reasons:

- firstly, inspired by Jess Frazelle's desktop apps on kube ( @github/jessfraz https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles), I thought to myself 'Why not put this all on Kube also ? How hard might that be ?'

- secondly, being iritated on how heavy minikube on amd64 is, I decided to rely only on a single node kubeadm cluster containers - this environment should give you enough kubernetes to start a cool project on your own

- thirdly - it's just also a super easy way to stand up a full CI/CD stack in less than 20 minutes

## What's included:

- [x] kubeadm single node cluster on your desktop
- [x] kubernetes dashboard
- [x] canal overlay networking. other ones commented out in script
- [x] working helm + tiller (I know , sec...)
- [x] traefik
- [x] secrets store (Vault)
- [x] some form of CI/CD : Drone
- [x] a DB/storage (Postgres)
- [x] minio endpoint
- [x] self-contained docker image registry

## Prerequisites/Requirements

- 4GB of memory
- 3 cores
- 6 GB of disk space
- Ubuntu Xenial
- sudo password
- docker installed
- no fancy network setup
- (optional) Vagrant installed

## How do I start ?

### Running on localhost

If you're a happy owner of a Xenial derivative of a Linux distro, clone the repo, and just do ```./install-kubeadm.sh``` - this will install basic one-node kubeadm cluster and needed prerequisites.

To install full CI stack, fire up ```./deploy-ci-stack.sh``` afterwards and then do ```cat /etc/hosts``` to see what apps are available. For more details go to each app dir.

To launch semi-working version of Firefox on kube, go to apps directory.

#### Running example deployment on localhost (golang demo)

Go to the `examples` directory, launch the `create-examples.sh` script, it will create the `gitadmin` user (password: `gitadmin`). When asked, go to [http://drone.mykube.awesome](http://drone.mykube.awesome), grab an API token and paste it in the terminal. The script will then build the example, push it to the internal registry, deploy it and create an ingress with the address [http://example-golang-app.mykube.awesome](http://example-golang-app.mykube.awesome) in a few minutes.

### Running on Vagrant

Should be as simple as:
- Running ```vagrant up```, assuming you've latest Vagrant installed
- Running ```deploy-localhost-ingresses.sh``` to add /etc/host aliases to localhost

To connect to the VM, run ```vagrant ssh```, there should be kubectl already configured for you. To connect to any app with localhost web browser, check ```/etc/hosts``` file for alias name, and then open ```http://ALIAS:1080``` (as vagrant redirects port 80 VM -> port 1080 localhost for treafik ingress controller)

#### Running example deployment on Vagrant (golang demo)

The process is mostly identical to localhost, except the commands should be ran in a `vagrant ssh` session, and the URLs have `:1080` at the end of the hostname: [http://drone.mykube.awesome:1080](http://drone.mykube.awesome:1080) and [http://example-golang-app.mykube.awesome:1080](http://example-golang-app.mykube.awesome:1080).

## How do I ..

### Launch a kube dashboard ?

Traefik reverse proxy listens on a NodePort 30000/TCP in non-tls fashion, and ingress is being created to it at the script start (see **ingress** directory), so if all installed correctly, you just need to open up: ```http://dashboard.mykube.awesome/```

### Traefik dashboard ?

NodePort 30001/TCP non-tls, or: ```http://traefik.mykube.awesome/```

### Deploy my own app ?

Look into **deploy* and **ingress** directories for examples, then ```kubectl -f apply ...``` them. Send me a PR if you dockerize a cool app.

## FAQ - aka can I get this ported to X (before you raise an issue) ?

- **Mac OSX** - well you may try, I accept PRs, but probably it'll be easier to just use minikube on Docker Edge channel and strip up extras to be deployed on top of it
- **Windows** - NO
- **Armhf/Arm64 (Raspberry/Odroid/100s others)** - is kubeadm/helm/traefik available there yet ? Let's talk if you need that.

## Wishlist

Next things that would be handy to run on this:

- [ ] ark backups
- [ ] more desktop apps
- [ ] self-signed TLS
- [ ] bash code cleanup
- [ ] templatize the whole lot using golang templates (https://github.com/VirtusLab/render, https://medium.com/virtuslab/helm-alternative-d6568aa9d40b)
- [ ] some auth servers for development (dex, keycloak)
- [ ] more storage support (druid, ES, cockroach, TiDB)
- [ ] bigdata/ML demos?
- [ ] example projects in various languages
- [ ] tracing/logging
- [ ] whatever else

### What might be problematic ?

- Running helm charts that use PV/PVCs - I'm using only hostpaths here so far
- Running services that want loadbalancers

### What's next ?

Well, here's an interesting concept maintaned at https://github.com/leblancd/Kube-in-the-Box
