 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) runs on an existing webserver.
 It manages user, group and host accounts. Currently LAM
 supports these account types: Samba 3/4, Unix, Kolab,
 address book entries, NIS mail aliases and MAC addresses.
 There is an integrated LDAP browser to allow access to the
 raw LDAP attributes. You can use templates
 for account creation and use multiple configuration profiles.
 Account information can be exported as PDF file. There is also
 a script included which manages quotas and homedirectories.
