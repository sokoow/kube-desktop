This package installs the lamdaemon scripts on the server where
home directories and/or quotas are managed.

The scripts are called by the main LDAP Account Manager installation
via SSH.

You will have to setup sudo for these scripts. Please see the
documentation in package ldap-account-manager for this topic.

Example sudo entry:

someuser  ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/share/ldap-account-manager/lib/lamdaemon.pl *
